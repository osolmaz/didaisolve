<p>This website tracks well-known open problems in science, technology, and mathematics, and flags any breakthroughs that might arise from <strong>AGI</strong> or other advanced AI systems (e.g., OpenAI’s next-generation models).</p>

<h2 id="why-this-project">Why This Project?</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Clarity</strong>: Many “open problem” websites exist, but we specifically focus on whether <strong>AI</strong> has contributed a verifiable solution.</li>
  <li><strong>Updates</strong>: If and when a problem is solved—or partially solved—we’ll update the metadata to reflect that change.</li>
  <li><strong>Future AGI</strong>: As AI grows more powerful, we want a one-stop location to confirm if a major problem is still unsolved or definitively resolved.</li>
</ul>

<p>For general inquiries or to report a solution, please open an issue on our <a href="https://github.com/YourUsername/didaisolve">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
