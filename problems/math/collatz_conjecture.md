- The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer *n*.
- If *n* is even, divide it by 2, and if *n* is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
- The conjecture is that no matter what value of *n* you start with, the sequence will always reach 1.
