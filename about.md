# About Did AI Solve?

This website tracks well-known open problems in science, technology, and mathematics, and flags any breakthroughs that might arise from **AGI** or other advanced AI systems (e.g., OpenAI's next-generation models).

## Why This Project?

- **Clarity**: Many "open problem" websites exist, but we specifically focus on whether **AI** has contributed a verifiable solution.
- **Updates**: If and when a problem is solved—or partially solved—we’ll update the metadata to reflect that change.
- **Future AGI**: As AI grows more powerful, we want a one-stop location to confirm if a major problem is still unsolved or definitively resolved.

For general inquiries or to report a solution, please open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/YourUsername/didaisolve).
