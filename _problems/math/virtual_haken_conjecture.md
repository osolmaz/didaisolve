The Virtual Haken conjecture relates to the field of 3-dimensional topology. It postulates that every compact, orientable, irreducible 3-manifold with infinite fundamental group is virtually Haken, meaning it has a finite cover that is a Haken manifold. This conjecture has significant connections to other conjectures in topology, including Thurston's geometrization conjecture.
