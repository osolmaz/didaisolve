A combinatorial problem in geometry that asks for the minimum number of points in the plane in general position (not all on a single line) that guarantee the presence of a subset that forms a convex polygon with a given number of vertices. The problem is motivated by a famous theorem ensuring a convex quadrilateral among any five points in the plane.
