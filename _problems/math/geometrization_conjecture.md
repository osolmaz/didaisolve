The Geometrization conjecture, proposed by William Thurston, is a unifying conjecture in the field of three-manifold topology that suggests every three-dimensional manifold can be decomposed into pieces that have uniform geometric structures. Grigori Perelman's work, particularly his series of preprints from 2002 to 2003, made significant headway towards proving this conjecture.
