Hermite's problem investigates whether for any given natural number \( n \), there exists a way to assign a sequence of natural numbers to each real number such that the sequence becomes periodic if and only if the real number is algebraic of degree \( n \). This problem explores the interplay between number sequences and algebraic properties of real numbers.
