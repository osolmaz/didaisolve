The standard conjectures on algebraic cycles are a set of proposed relationships and general principles about the behavior and properties of algebraic cycles within the framework of algebraic geometry. These conjectures were introduced by Alexander Grothendieck and are considered foundational for understanding the interaction between algebraic cycles and cohomology theories.
