This open problem questions whether there exists an infinite number of prime numbers within the sequence of Pell numbers, which are defined recursively with the initial terms 0 and 1, and each subsequent term given by the sum of two times the previous term and the term before that. The problem explores the intersection of number theory and prime number studies.
