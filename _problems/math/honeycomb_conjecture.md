The conjecture states that a hexagonal grid, or honeycomb, is the most efficient way to partition a plane into regions of equal area, minimizing the total perimeter. The problem was proven by Thomas Callister Hales in 1999, providing a solution to a question that had intrigued mathematicians for centuries.
