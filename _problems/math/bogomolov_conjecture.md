The Bogomolov conjecture is related to algebraic geometry and number theory, focusing on the distribution of rational points on algebraic varieties with a particular emphasis on curves of genus greater than zero and their embedding into projective space. It was resolved for certain cases by Emmanuel Ullmo and Shou-Wu Zhang in 1998.
