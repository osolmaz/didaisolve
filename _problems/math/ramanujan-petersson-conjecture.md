This conjecture involves a set of generalizations related to the behavior of Fourier coefficients of modular forms, originally formulated by Srinivasa Ramanujan and later extended by Hans Petersson. It encompasses deep results in the analytic theory of automorphic forms and has significant implications in number theory.
