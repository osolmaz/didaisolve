This problem explores whether the converse of Wolstenholme's theorem holds true for all natural numbers. Wolstenholme's theorem is related to properties of binomial coefficients and modular arithmetic, specifically concerning primes and divisibility constraints. The converse conjecture asks if the conditions can be reversed in a meaningful way across all natural numbers.
