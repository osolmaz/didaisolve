The concept of cluster primes arises from extending the traditional notion of prime numbers. A cluster prime is defined within a specific mathematical context, where groups or clusters of prime numbers exhibit certain properties or patterns. The question remains whether the total number of these cluster primes is infinite, which is an ongoing area of inquiry in number theory.
