Hilbert's eleventh problem asks for the classification of quadratic forms over algebraic number fields. This problem is one of the famous 23 problems presented by David Hilbert in 1900, and it seeks to understand how these mathematical expressions can be structured when their coefficients belong to algebraic number fields.
