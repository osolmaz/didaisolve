The conjecture relates to a surprising connection between mock modular forms, which are functions that exhibit certain symmetry properties, and the representation theory of finite groups, extending the scope of the 'moonshine' phenomenon observed initially in the Monster group case. It was formulated by John F. R. Duncan, Michael J. Griffin, and Ken Ono.
