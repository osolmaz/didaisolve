The Carpenter's Rule Problem asks if every simple polygonal chain in the plane can be straightened by a sequence of continuous motions that avoid self-intersection. The problem involves studying the properties of linkages and how they can be manipulated without breaking the sequence or allowing it to intersect itself.
