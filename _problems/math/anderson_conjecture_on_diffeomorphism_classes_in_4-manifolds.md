This conjecture pertains to the classification of 4-manifolds by asserting that there exist only finitely many diffeomorphism types among those that satisfy certain fixed properties. It was notably discussed by Jeff Cheeger and Aaron Naber in 2014, and remains an open question in the field of geometric topology.
