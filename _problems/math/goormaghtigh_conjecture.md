The conjecture pertains to integer solutions of the equation \((x^m-1)/(x-1) = (y^n-1)/(y-1)\) where \(x\) and \(y\) are greater than 1 and both \(m\) and \(n\) exceed 2. It explores the conditions under which these equivalences exist, challenging mathematicians to find comprehensive solutions matching these criteria.
