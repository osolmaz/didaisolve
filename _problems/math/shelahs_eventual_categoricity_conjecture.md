The conjecture asserts the existence of a function that assigns to every cardinal a threshold beyond which an abstract elementary class, with a specified LÃ¶wenheim-Skolem number, being categorical implies categoricity in all larger cardinals. This is a significant open question in model theory and abstract algebra.
