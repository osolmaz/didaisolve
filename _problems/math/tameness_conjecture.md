The tameness conjecture is a significant hypothesis in the field of hyperbolic geometry and 3-manifolds. It suggests that every complete hyperbolic 3-manifold with finitely generated fundamental group is homeomorphic to the interior of a compact 3-manifold. This conjecture plays an important role in understanding the topology and geometry of 3-dimensional spaces.
