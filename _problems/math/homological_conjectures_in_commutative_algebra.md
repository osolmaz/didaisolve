Homological conjectures in commutative algebra encompass a set of hypotheses that concern the homological properties of commutative rings and their modules. These conjectures often relate to conditions under which certain homological dimensions of rings and modules are finite, and they are central to understanding the deeper algebraic structures inherent in commutative algebra.
