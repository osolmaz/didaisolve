This problem inquires whether there exists an ergodic system with a simple Lebesgue spectrum, which is a question in the field of dynamical systems and measure theory. Ergodic systems are those where, informally, the system, when evolved over time, explores the entirety of its possible states in a uniform manner. The spectrum refers to the decomposition of the system's evolution, and this problem asks if it can be decomposed into simpler terms using the concept of the Lebesgue spectrum.
