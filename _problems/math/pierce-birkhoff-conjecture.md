The conjecture proposes that any function from the n-dimensional real space to the real numbers that is piecewise defined by polynomial functions can be expressed using a process of taking maximums and minimums over finite sets of these polynomials. This mathematical statement concerns the nature of piecewise-polynomial functions.
