This conjecture proposes that the crossing number of a graph can be lower-bounded by the crossing number of a complete graph sharing the same chromatic number. The crossing number relates to the number of edge crossings in a drawing of a graph, while the chromatic number is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
