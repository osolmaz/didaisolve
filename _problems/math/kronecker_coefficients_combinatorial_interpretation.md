The challenge is to find a combinatorial interpretation of the Kronecker coefficients, which appear in representation theory when expressing the tensor product of two Schur functions as a sum of Schur functions. These coefficients are notoriously difficult to understand combinatorially compared to their cousin, the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.
