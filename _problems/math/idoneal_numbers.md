Determine the exact count of idoneal numbers, also known as Euler's idoneal numbers or suitable numbers. It is currently unknown whether there are 65, 66, or 67 such numbers that fit the criteria defined in number theory. Idoneal numbers are significant in the study of quadratic forms and have various properties related to prime numbers and divisors.
