Harary's conjecture involves determining the integral sum number of complete graphs. This area of research seeks to understand properties related to graph theory and number theory, specifically how integers can sum to certain structures within complete graphs. Formulated by Zhibo Chen in 1996, the conjecture remains unsolved.
