The modularity theorem, originally known as the Taniyamaâ€“Shimura-Weil conjecture, connects elliptic curves over the rational numbers with modular forms. It was crucial in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, with significant contributions made by mathematicians such as Christophe Breuil, Brian Conrad, Fred Diamond, and Richard Taylor in 2001.
