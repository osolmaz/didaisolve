The problem explores the maximum pathwidth that an n-vertex cubic graph can achieve. A cubic graph is a graph where each vertex has exactly three edges. Understanding the pathwidth of such graphs could have implications in various fields including graph theory and computer science. Pathwidth is a measure of how "tree-like" a graph is, which relates to concepts such as graph layout problems and optimization.
