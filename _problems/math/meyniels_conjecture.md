Meyniel's conjecture proposes that the cop number, a concept from graph theory concerning the minimum number of cops needed to guarantee the capture of a robber on a graph, is bounded by O(âˆšn) for any connected graph with n vertices. This conjecture remains an open problem and seeks to establish tighter bounds on the cop number beyond the existing linear constraints.
