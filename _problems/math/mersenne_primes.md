The question of whether there are infinitely many Mersenne primes, which are primes of the form 2^p - 1 where p is also a prime number, remains an open problem. This is closely related to the infinite nature of even perfect numbers, given the known correspondence between these sequences as suggested by the Lenstra–Pomerance–Wagstaff conjecture.
