A major unsolved problem in algebraic geometry, this conjecture proposes a relationship between algebraic cycles and cohomology classes of a non-singular complex algebraic variety. It suggests that certain de Rham cohomology classes are algebraic, providing deep insight into the structure of algebraic varieties.
