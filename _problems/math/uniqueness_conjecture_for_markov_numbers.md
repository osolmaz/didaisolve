The uniqueness conjecture posits that each Markov number appears as the largest number in exactly one normalized solution of the Markov Diophantine equation. This open problem remains a compelling question in the study of number theory and Diophantine equations, inviting mathematicians to explore the structural properties of Markov numbers and their unique roles in solutions.
