Consider a complete first-order theory where the class of atomic models is categorical in some cardinality. The question is whether this categoricity in a certain infinite cardinal â„µn implies categoricity in all cardinalities. This is a significant problem in the field of model theory, as categoricity in various cardinalities is related to the structure and properties of models.
