Hartshorne's conjectures are a set of predictions or hypotheses in the field of algebraic geometry, proposed by the mathematician Robin Hartshorne. They concern properties of algebraic varieties, specifically about which varieties are rationally connected or have certain types of morphisms. These conjectures have guided research in understanding the structure and classification of varieties.
