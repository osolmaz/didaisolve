Schinzel's hypothesis H is a conjecture in number theory that proposes a condition on collections of nonconstant irreducible polynomials with positive leading coefficients. It predicts that, for these polynomials, either there are infinitely many natural numbers for which all the polynomial evaluations are simultaneously prime, or there exists a common divisor greater than one that divides some evaluation of the polynomials for every integer input.
