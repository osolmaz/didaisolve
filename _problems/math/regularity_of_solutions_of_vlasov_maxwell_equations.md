The problem involves understanding the regularity, or smoothness, of solutions to the Vlasov–Maxwell equations, which are a set of equations governing the evolution of a distribution function of charged particles in a plasma under the influence of electromagnetic fields. This is a fundamental problem in mathematical physics with relevance to plasma physics, where issues of existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions remain challenging.
