The challenge involves bounding the function Î”k(x), which is defined as the difference between Dk(x), a generalized divisor summatory function, and xPk(log(x)), a polynomial expression in terms of the logarithm of x. This problem extends the classical divisor problem to higher dimensions and explores asymptotic properties related to number theory.
