The Stark conjectures are a set of conjectures in number theory proposed by Harold Stark in the 1970s. They relate the special values of L-functions to algebraic numbers, especially focusing on properties of units in number fields. One part of these conjectures, known as the Brumerâ€“Stark conjecture, specifically addresses the existence of certain units related to abelian extensions of number fields. Despite progress in specific cases, the conjectures remain largely unresolved.
