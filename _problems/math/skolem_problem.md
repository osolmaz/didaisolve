This problem asks whether there is an algorithm that can determine if a constant-recursive sequence contains a zero. Constant-recursive sequences are sequences where each term is a linear combination of a fixed number of preceding terms, with constant coefficients. The question of algorithmically identifying the presence of a zero in such sequences remains open.
