A central question in set theory is whether there is a core model that can accommodate all known large cardinal axioms. This model would serve as the most inclusive framework for understanding the hierarchy of large cardinals and their properties, assuming their consistency. The challenge is in finding and characterizing such a model that unifies all large cardinals.
