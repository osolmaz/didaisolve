Investigate the possibility of constructing a 3×3 magic square where each of the 9 entries is a distinct perfect square number. Such a magic square would maintain the property that the sums of numbers in each row, column, and diagonal are equal, raising curiosity about the constraints and potential arrangements within the realm of perfect squares.
