The conjecture posits that if a group has a cohomological dimension of 2, then it necessarily possesses a 2-dimensional Eilenberg–MacLane space K(G,1). This problem falls within the domain of algebraic topology and investigates the relationship between cohomological properties of a group and the geometry of the associated topological space.
