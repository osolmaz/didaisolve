The problem explores the inequality involving cardinal exponentiation where if aleph-omega is a strong limit cardinal, whether the result of raising two to the power of aleph-omega is less than aleph-omega1. This is related to the singular cardinals hypothesis, and the best known bound for this inequality is aleph-omega4, as shown by mathematician Saharon Shelah using PCF (possible cofinality) theory.
