The Erdős–Straus conjecture proposes that for any integer n greater than or equal to 2, there exist positive integer solutions x, y, and z such that the equation 4/n equals the sum of the reciprocals of x, y, and z. The conjecture remains unproven despite extensive numerical testing and partial results.
