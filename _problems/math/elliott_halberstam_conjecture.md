The conjecture deals with the distribution of prime numbers in arithmetic progressions, proposing a specific bound on the error term in the prime number theorem for arithmetic progressions. It generalizes previous work by Bombieri and Vinogradov, and its resolution could have implications for other areas of number theory, including the understanding of gaps between primes.
