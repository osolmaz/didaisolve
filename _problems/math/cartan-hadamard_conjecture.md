The conjecture asks whether the classical isoperimetric inequality, which relates the surface area and volume of geometric shapes in Euclidean space, can be generalized to spaces with nonpositive curvature, specifically Cartan–Hadamard manifolds. These are complete simply connected Riemannian manifolds with nonpositive sectional curvature everywhere.
