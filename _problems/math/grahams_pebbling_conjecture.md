This conjecture concerns the pebbling number, a graph invariant related to the minimum number of pebbles needed on a graph so that it is possible to place a pebble on any vertex via a series of pebbling moves. The open problem focuses on determining the pebbling number for Cartesian products of graphs, an area with intriguing complexity and depth in combinatorial mathematics.
