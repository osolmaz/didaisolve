The Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture is a statement in metric number theory concerning the approximation of real numbers by rationals and the distribution of reduced fractions under specific conditions. The conjecture connects the measure of the set of numbers that can be approximated with a given error threshold to the sum of certain series defined by this threshold.
