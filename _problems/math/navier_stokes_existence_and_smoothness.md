The problem involves determining whether solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe fluid motion, always exist in three-dimensional space and whether they remain smooth (i.e., free of singularities) over time. This is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems for which proving or disproving either scenario could earn a significant monetary reward.
