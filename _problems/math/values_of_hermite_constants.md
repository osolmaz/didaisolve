The challenge involves determining the Hermite constants for lattice dimensions other than the known cases of dimensions 1â€“8 and 24. These constants are critical in the geometry of numbers, representing the supremum of the minima of quadratic forms. They have implications in optimization and number theory related to sphere packings and lattice coverings.
