The problem investigates the consistency of the Open Coloring Axiom (OCA) with the cardinality inequality 2 raised to the power of ℵ0 being greater than ℵ2, where 2^{ℵ0} corresponds to the cardinality of the continuum. This question is important in the field of set theory and investigates possible implications of the OCA on cardinal arithmetic.
