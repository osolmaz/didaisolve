The Dodecahedral conjecture is a problem in discrete geometry, related to sphere packing in three dimensions. It asserts that no packing of similarly sized spheres has a lower average maximum measure than the Voronoi decomposition associated with the dodecahedron. The conjecture was proposed by Thomas Hales and Sean McLaughlin.
