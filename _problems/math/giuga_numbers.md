This problem asks whether there are infinitely many numbers fulfilling the unique property that if a number is a Giuga number, then for every prime divisor \( p \) of that number, \( n \equiv -1 \pmod{(p-1)} \). Despite being studied for some time, the question of their infinite existence remains unanswered.
