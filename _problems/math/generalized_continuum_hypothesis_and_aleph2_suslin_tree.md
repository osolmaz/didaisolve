This problem asks whether the generalized continuum hypothesis (GCH), a hypothesis about the possible sizes of infinite sets, implies the existence of a special type of tree known as an ℵ2-Suslin tree, which is related to the concept of Suslin lines and orderings. The question remains unanswered and is a topic of interest in set theory and mathematical logic.
