The conjecture is a mathematical hypothesis concerning a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. If n is even, divide it by 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. The conjecture asserts that, no matter which number you start with, you will eventually reach the number 1.
