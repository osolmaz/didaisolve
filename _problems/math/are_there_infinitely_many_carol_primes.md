This problem explores whether the set of Carol primes continues indefinitely. Carol primes are a special class of prime numbers of the form \(4^n - 2^{n+1} - 1\) for some integer \(n\). As with many families of primes, it remains an open question in mathematics whether there are an infinite number of such primes.
