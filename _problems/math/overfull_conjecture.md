The conjecture addresses the conditions under which a graph belongs to class 2 according to Vizing's theorem. Specifically, it claims that if a graph has maximum degree at least n/3, then it is class 2 if and only if it contains an overfull subgraph with the same maximum degree as the graph itself.
