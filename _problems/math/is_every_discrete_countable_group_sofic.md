The question asks whether every group that is both discrete and countable can be classified as sofic. Sofic groups, introduced in the early 2000s, form a class that generalizes amenable and residually finite groups, and they play an important role in group theory and its applications. The classification of countable groups as sofic or not remains an open problem within the mathematical community.
