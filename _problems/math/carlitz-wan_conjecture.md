The Carlitz–Wan conjecture concerns the number of points on certain algebraic curves over finite fields. It is named after Leonard Carlitz and Zhi-Wei Wan, and has potential implications in number theory and algebraic geometry. The conjecture was posed by mathematician Hendrik Lenstra in the mid-1990s.
