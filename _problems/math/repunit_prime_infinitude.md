The problem asks whether there are infinitely many prime numbers in the form of repunits for any integer base \( b \) that does not satisfy certain conditions. Specifically, the base \( b \) must not be a perfect power and not of the form \(-4k^4\) for an integer \( k \). A repunit is a number consisting entirely of ones in a given base.
