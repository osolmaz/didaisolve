The question asks whether there is an infinite number of Fibonacci numbers that are also prime. Fibonacci numbers are a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, and prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 with no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The challenge is to determine if the intersection of these two mathematical sets is infinite.
