The Fermat–Catalan Conjecture asserts that there are only finitely many solutions to the equation \(a^m + b^n = c^k\) where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are positive coprime integers, and \(m\), \(n\), and \(k\) are positive integers that satisfy \(1/m + 1/n + 1/k < 1\). This statement is significant in the field of number theory as it combines elements of Fermat's Last Theorem and Catalan's conjecture, suggesting a deep relationship between powers and sums.
