Pollock's conjectures encompass mathematical hypotheses proposed by Sir Frederick Pollock in the 19th century, which include conjectures on numbers such as the generalization of the Waring's problem to tetrahedral numbers and the representation of numbers as sums of distinct numbers. These conjectures remain open and unproven, capturing the interest of mathematicians who explore the intricacies of number representation and combinatorial number theory.
