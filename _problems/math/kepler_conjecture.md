The Kepler Conjecture is a hypothesis about the most efficient way to pack spheres in a given space. Specifically, it proposes that no arrangement of equally sized spheres filling space has a greater average density than that of the face-centered cubic packing or the hexagonal close packing. Originally posited by Johannes Kepler in 1611, the problem remained unsolved for centuries, challenging mathematicians with its simplicity and complexity.
