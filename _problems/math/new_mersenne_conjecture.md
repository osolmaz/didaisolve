The New Mersenne conjecture is related to odd natural numbers and asserts that if any two of the conditions involving expressions of the form \( p = 2^k \pm 1 \), \( p = 4^k \pm 3 \), \( 2^p - 1 \) is prime, and \( (2^p + 1)/3 \) is prime hold true, then the third condition must also be true. This conjecture involves the interrelationship between numbers and certain forms of primes.
