This open problem involves determining the characteristics of planar graphs with respect to their word representability. A word-representable graph is a graph that can be represented by a word such that vertices x and y are adjacent if and only if x and y alternate in the word. The challenge is to identify which planar graphs possess this property, as well as those that do not.
