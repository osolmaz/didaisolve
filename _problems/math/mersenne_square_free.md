This open problem asks whether every Mersenne number with a prime exponent is square-free. A number is square-free if it is not divisible by any perfect square other than 1. Mersenne numbers, which are of the form \( M_p = 2^p - 1 \), where \( p \) is a prime number, have special significance in mathematics, particularly in number theory. This question investigates their prime decomposition characteristics.
