The conjecture, proposed by Eugène Charles Catalan in 1844, posited that 8 and 9 are the only two consecutive perfect powers among natural numbers. After remaining an open problem for over 150 years, it was resolved by mathematician Preda Mihăilescu in 2002, and is now known as Mihăilescu's theorem.
