The question of whether an infinite number of Wagstaff primes exist remains open. Wagstaff primes are a special class of prime numbers expressed in the form \((2^p + 1) / 3\), where \(p\) itself is a prime number. These numbers are of interest in number theory due to their connection with Mersenne primes and their use in cryptographic applications.
