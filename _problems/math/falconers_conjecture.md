In Euclidean space, if a set has a Hausdorff dimension greater than half the dimension of the space, then the set of distances between points in this set should have positive Lebesgue measure. Falconer's conjecture is a key open question in geometric measure theory, exploring the relationship between distance sets and dimensionality of point sets.
