The problem involves determining whether it is possible to dissect simplices of all dimensions into orthoschemes. An orthoscheme is a specific type of simplex with orthogonal facets, and this question explores the possibility of disassembling any simplex, regardless of its dimensionality, into such orthoschemes.
