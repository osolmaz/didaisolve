The challenge is to determine whether there exist universal point sets of subquadratic size that can represent all planar graphs. A universal point set is a set of points in the plane such that any planar graph can be drawn without crossings, using only the points from this set as the vertices. This problem is significant in computational geometry and graph drawing.
