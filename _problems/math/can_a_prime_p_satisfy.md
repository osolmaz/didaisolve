Investigate whether there exists a prime number _p_ that simultaneously satisfies the congruences 2^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p^2) and 3^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p^2). These conditions relate to unusual properties of primes and modular arithmetic, posing a challenge for mathematicians seeking to understand their deeper implications.
