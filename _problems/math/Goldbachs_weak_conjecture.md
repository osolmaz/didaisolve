Goldbach's weak conjecture suggests that every odd integer greater than 5 can be expressed as the sum of three prime numbers. Despite significant progress and partial proofs, a complete proof for all odd integers has historically remained elusive, though substantial work has been done by mathematicians like Harald Helfgott.
