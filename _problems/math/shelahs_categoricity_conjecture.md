The conjecture states that if a logic sentence within the context of infinitary logic \(L_{\omega_1,\omega}\) is categorical in some cardinality above the Hanf number, then it should be categorical in all larger cardinalities beyond that Hanf number. The Hanf number is a cardinal number above which certain properties hold for models of infinite languages.
