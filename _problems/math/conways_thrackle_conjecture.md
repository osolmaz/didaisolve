This conjecture claims that in a type of graph drawing known as a thrackle, the number of edges cannot exceed the number of vertices. Thrackles are characterized by the property that every pair of edges meets exactly once, either at a shared vertex or at a crossing. The conjecture has intrigued mathematicians due to its simplicity and yet elusive proof.
