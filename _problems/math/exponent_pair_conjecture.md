The conjecture questions whether for every positive ε, the pair (ε, 1/2 + ε) can be considered an "exponent pair" with respect to Van der Corput's method in analytic number theory. The resolution of this conjecture would have significant implications for understanding the limits of certain inequalities and methods used in number theory.
