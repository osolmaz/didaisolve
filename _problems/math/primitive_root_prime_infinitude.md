This open problem in number theory asks whether, for a given integer _a_ that is neither a perfect square nor equals to âˆ’1, there are infinitely many prime numbers for which _a_ is a primitive root. A primitive root of a prime _p_ is an integer _g_ such that every integer that is coprime to _p_ is a power of _g_ modulo _p_.
