The problem investigates whether there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive prime numbers that are at most a fixed distance apart, which implies that prime numbers continue to occur close to one another infinitely often in the set of natural numbers. Research in this area has made significant progress, particularly through the works of Yitang Zhang, the Polymath Project, and James Maynard.
