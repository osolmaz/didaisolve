Landau's problems are four well-known unsolved problems in number theory proposed by Edmund Landau in 1912. They involve some basic yet elusive questions about prime numbers, including the Goldbach conjecture and twin prime conjecture. Despite significant progress, these problems remain open and continue to inspire mathematical research.
