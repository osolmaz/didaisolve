The main gap conjecture relates to the classification of mathematical structures by their complexities, particularly focusing on uncountable first order theories, abstract elementary classes (AECs), and â„µ1-saturated models of a countable theory. It concerns understanding the precise nature of gaps in these structures' complexity or definability.
