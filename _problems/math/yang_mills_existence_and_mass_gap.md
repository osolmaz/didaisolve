The problem involves proving that a quantum field theory such as Yang-Mills exists according to certain mathematical properties and that there is a positive mass gap between the lowest energy state and the first excited state, reflecting a key aspect of observable particle interactions in physics. This is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems.
