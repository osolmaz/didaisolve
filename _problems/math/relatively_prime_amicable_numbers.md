Investigate whether there exist any pairs of amicable numbers that are also relatively prime. Amicable numbers are two different numbers so related that the sum of the proper divisors of each is equal to the other number. Relatively prime numbers are pairs of numbers that have no common divisor other than 1. The challenge is to find pairs fulfilling both these conditions.
