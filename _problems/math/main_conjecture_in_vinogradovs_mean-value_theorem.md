This conjecture relates to the asymptotic behavior of exponential sums and has implications for estimating the number of solutions to systems of diagonal equations. It was a major open problem in analytic number theory and received a significant breakthrough by Jean Bourgain, Ciprian Demeter, and Larry Guth in 2015. The full resolution and implications are still an area of active research.
