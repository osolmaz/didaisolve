This problem asks whether all reversible cellular automata in three or more dimensions possess the property of local reversibility. Cellular automata are mathematical models in which patterns evolve over discrete time steps according to a set of rules based on the states of neighboring cells. Understanding the conditions under which reversibility implies locality remains an open question in the field.
