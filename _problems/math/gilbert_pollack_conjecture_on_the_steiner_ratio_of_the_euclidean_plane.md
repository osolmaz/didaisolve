The conjecture asserts that the Steiner ratio of the Euclidean plane, which relates to the efficiency of connecting points in the plane with the shortest possible network of lines, is 3/2. This involves determining the most optimal way to connect a set of points with potentially additional intermediate points (Steiner points) to minimize the total length.
