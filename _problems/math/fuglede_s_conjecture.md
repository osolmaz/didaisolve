Fuglede's conjecture explores the relationship between the spectral properties of sets and their ability to tile space through translation. Specifically, it asks whether nonconvex sets in Euclidean spaces, such as \(\mathbb{R}\) and \(\mathbb{R}^2\), can be characterized as spectral if they can tile the space by translation. This intriguing problem bridges the areas of harmonic analysis and geometry.
