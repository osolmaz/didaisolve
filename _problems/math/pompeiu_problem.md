The Pompeiu problem explores conditions regarding the topology of domains that allow a non-zero continuous function to have integrals which vanish over every congruent copy of a given domain in Euclidean space. It represents a significant challenge in the field of analysis, involving geometric properties and potential implications in harmonic analysis.
