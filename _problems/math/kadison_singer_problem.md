This mathematical problem was first posed in 1959 in the context of functional analysis and operator theory. It questioned the uniqueness of certain extensions of pure states, with implications for signal processing, coding theory, and frame theory in Hilbert spaces. The problem was affirmatively resolved in a major breakthrough in 2013, which also implied the truth of several other conjectures in related areas, such as Feichtinger's conjecture, Anderson's paving conjecture, and the Bourgain-Tzafriri conjecture.
