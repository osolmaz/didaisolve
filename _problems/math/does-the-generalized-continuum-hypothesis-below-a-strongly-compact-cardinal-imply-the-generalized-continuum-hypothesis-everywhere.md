This problem asks whether the validity of the generalized continuum hypothesis (GCH) below some types of large cardinals, specifically strongly compact cardinals, would necessitate the truth of GCH in all contexts. This question explores the interactions between set theory's large cardinals and the continuum hypothesis across different realms of mathematics.
