Weibel's conjecture is an open problem in the field of algebraic $K$-theory, related to the dimensions for which the homotopy $K$-theory of a ring vanishes. It was proposed by Charles Weibel and addresses fundamental questions about negative $K$-groups. The development of this conjecture has implications on understanding the structure of rings and their associated categories.
