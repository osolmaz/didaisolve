This problem explores the existence of infinitely many prime numbers expressed in the form of a specific polynomial fraction with respect to given parameters. The challenge is to determine whether for any integers \( k \geq 1 \), \( b \geq 2 \), and \( c \neq 0 \), where the greatest common divisor of \( k \) and \( c \), and \( b \) and \( c \) both equal 1, there are infinitely many primes that can be formed. The expression involves evaluating \((k \times b^n + c) / \text{gcd}(k+c, b-1)\) for integer \( n \geq 1 \).
