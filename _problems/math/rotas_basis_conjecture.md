This open problem in matroid theory asserts that given a matroid of rank n with n disjoint bases, it is possible to arrange them in an n√ón matrix such that not only are the rows bases, but the columns constitute bases as well. This conjecture relates to combinatorial constructions and stands as an intriguing challenge in mathematics.
