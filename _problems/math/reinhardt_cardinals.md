Reinhardt cardinals are a type of large cardinal in set theory, and the associated open problem investigates whether a nontrivial elementary embedding \(V \to V\) can exist in the absence of the axiom of choice. Such an embedding would map the universe of sets into itself while preserving the structure of set membership, posing intriguing implications for the foundations of mathematics.
