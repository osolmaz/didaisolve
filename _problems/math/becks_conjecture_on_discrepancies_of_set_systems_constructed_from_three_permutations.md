In 2011, Alantha Newman and Aleksandar Nikolov highlighted Beck's conjecture, which deals with the discrepancies that arise within set systems constructed from three permutations. This problem explores the mathematical irregularities and distribution balances within these sets, aiming to find a systematic resolution or explanation for them. The conjecture remains unsolved, continuing to challenge mathematicians in the field of combinatorics and discrepancy theory.
