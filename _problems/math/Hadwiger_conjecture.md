This conjecture in graph theory suggests a connection between graph coloring and the existence of complete graph minors. Specifically, it posits that if a graph is k-chromatic, then it contains a complete graph K_k as a minor. The conjecture is a major open problem in the field, relating the chromatic number of a graph to the existence of certain substructures.
