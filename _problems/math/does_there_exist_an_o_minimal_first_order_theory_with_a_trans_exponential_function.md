In mathematical logic and model theory, a key question is whether there exists an o-minimal first order theory that includes a trans-exponential function, one that exhibits rapid growth beyond exponential functions. This problem intersects with the study of o-minimality, which is concerned with structures allowing for tame topological properties.
