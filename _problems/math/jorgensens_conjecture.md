Jørgensen's conjecture involves the classification of certain graph structures. It posits that every 6-vertex-connected graph that does not have a _K_6 minor can be transformed into an apex graph by adding just one additional vertex. This conjecture remains an important question in the study of graph theory, particularly in understanding the properties of minor-free graphs.
