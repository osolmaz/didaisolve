The open problem inquires whether the logical theory for the field of Laurent series over the ring of p-adic integers, \(\mathbb{Z}_p\), is decidable. The question lies at the intersection of model theory and number theory, and understanding its implications could shed light on the logical behavior of fields constructed over p-adic numbers.
