Cullen primes are a special class of prime numbers that can be expressed in the form of \( n \times 2^n + 1 \). The open problem in mathematics is whether there are an infinite number of such primes. This question remains unanswered, contributing to the broader conversation on the distribution and nature of prime numbers.
