This conjecture, interconnected with the Quillen–Lichtenbaum and Beilinson–Lichtenbaum conjectures, relates to the fields of algebraic geometry and number theory. It involves the profound implications of motivic cohomology and its connection to algebraic K-theory, as advanced by mathematicians such as Vladimir Voevodsky, Thomas Geisser, and Marc Levine.
