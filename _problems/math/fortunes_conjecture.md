Fortune's conjecture suggests that each Fortunate number is a prime. A Fortunate number is derived from a sequence where for each positive integer \( n \), the number is the smallest integer greater than one that makes the product of the first \( n \) primes plus this number a prime. The conjecture remains unproven, with no known composite Fortunate numbers discovered.
