The conjecture addresses the conditions under which a polynomial with integer coefficients yields an infinite number of prime numbers as outputs when evaluated at positive integer inputs. It requires the polynomial to have a positive leading coefficient, be irreducible over the integers, and possess no common factor for all evaluations at positive integers.
