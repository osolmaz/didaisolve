A Fermat number is defined as one of the integers of the form \( F_n = 2^{2^n} + 1 \). The question asks whether every Fermat number is square-free, meaning none of its divisors is a perfect square greater than one. Although Fermat numbers have unique properties and interesting applications, it remains an open question whether they are all square-free.
