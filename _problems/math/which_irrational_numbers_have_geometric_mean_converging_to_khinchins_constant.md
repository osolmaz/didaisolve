A fundamental open question in mathematics involves identifying the classes or instances of irrational numbers whose continued fraction terms have a geometric mean converging to Khinchin's constant. Khinchin's constant emerges in the realm of number theory and is related to the average behavior of the digits in the continued fractions of almost all real numbers. This problem seeks to understand the specific conditions under which the continued fraction of an irrational number aligns with this property.
