Lehmer's conjecture deals with the Mahler measure of algebraic integers, specifically positing that there is a lower bound greater than one for the Mahler measure of non-cyclotomic polynomials with integer coefficients. This has profound implications in number theory, particularly concerning the distribution of algebraic numbers.
