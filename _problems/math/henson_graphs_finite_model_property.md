The question concerns whether Henson graphs possess the finite model property, which in logic and model theory, refers to the solvability of logical sentences in finite structures. Henson graphs are a specific type of countably infinite graph associated with forbidden subgraphs, and establishing their finite model property involves determining if every satisfiable sentence about them has a finite model.
