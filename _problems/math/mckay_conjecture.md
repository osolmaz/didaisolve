The conjecture proposes a relationship involving a finite group, an irreducible complex character, and the normalizer of a Sylow subgroup. Specifically, it posits that the count of irreducible complex characters of a group, which have a degree not divisible by a given prime, is equal to that within the associated normalizer of the group's Sylow subgroup.
