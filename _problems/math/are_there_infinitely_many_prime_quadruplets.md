A prime quadruplet refers to a set of four prime numbers where the largest and smallest numbers differ by 8, specifically in the form (p, p+2, p+6, p+8). The question asks whether there are an infinite number of such quadruplets, similar to inquiries about the infinitude of other classes of prime constellations.
