Recamán's sequence is a well-known mathematical sequence defined using a specific recursive rule involving subtraction and addition. A long-standing open question is whether every nonnegative integer will eventually appear in this sequence. Despite significant progress in analyzing its behavior, a comprehensive proof or disproof remains elusive.
