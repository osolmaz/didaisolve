The conjecture addresses the torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over number fields, implying that there is a finite list of possibilities for these torsion subgroups depending on the degree of the field extension over which the elliptic curve is defined. Lo√Øc Merel made significant contributions by proving the conjecture for number fields of any given degree.
