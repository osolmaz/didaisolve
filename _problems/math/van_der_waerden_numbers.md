Van der Waerden numbers are mathematical constants that play a crucial role in Ramsey theory, dealing with the existence of monochromatic arithmetic progressions in colorings of integers. Despite their importance, determining these numbers explicitly remains a difficult and unsolved problem in mathematics.
