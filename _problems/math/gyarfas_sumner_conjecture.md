This conjecture is related to the χ-boundedness in graph theory, particularly dealing with graphs that exclude a specific tree as an induced subgraph. It explores the conditions under which certain classes of graphs are χ-bounded, meaning there exists a function that bounds the chromatic number of the graph based on its clique number.
