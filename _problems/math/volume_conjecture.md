The Volume Conjecture proposes a surprising connection between quantum invariants of knots, specifically the values associated with the Jones polynomial, and the hyperbolic geometry of the knot complements. This conjecture suggests deep links between quantum topology and geometric topology, particularly for knots with hyperbolic structures.
