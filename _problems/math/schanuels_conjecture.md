Schanuel's conjecture revolves around the transcendence degree of certain field extensions of the rational numbers. A key question is whether the numbers π and e are algebraically independent. The conjecture also explores which nontrivial combinations of transcendental numbers, such as e+π, eπ, πe, ππ, and ee, are themselves transcendental.
