Greenberg's conjectures relate to the Iwasawa theory in number theory and make predictions about the structure of the p-adic class group of a number field. Specifically, they propose hypotheses about the behavior of these class groups in Zp-extensions, which are infinite extensions with specific arithmetic properties. Both conjectures are significant in understanding the deep interplay between number fields and their arithmetic invariants.
